            coordinator will be configured automatically when `num_processes` and `process_id` are

            for `jax_backend != "tpu"`.
        process_id: The process ID (the process rank). Needed only if distributed initialization is
            desired for `jax_backend != "tpu"`.
        initialization_timeout: The jax distributed initialization timeout in seconds. If None, uses
